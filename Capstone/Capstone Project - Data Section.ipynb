We get them by using the Python Librares \"urllib\" and \"Beautiful Soap\" to parse the XML-file of the website https://zipcode.org/city/OH/CLEVELAND.<br>\nThe page contains a list of ZIP Codes in Cleveland such as \"44114\", \"44124\" and \"44144\", which we will (using urllib, Beautiful Soup and Pandas) save in a DataFrame. <br>\n<br>\nIn the next step, we will again use urllib, BeautifulSoup and Pandas to scrape the data from https://gist.github.com/erichurst/7882666. This page contains a list of ZIP Codes all over the US and their geographical coordinates, example: 44114 (zip code), 41.520126 (latitude), -81.678083 (longitude). Having transferred these information into a Pandas DataFrame, we merge them to the existing DataFrame of Cleveland's ZIP Codes.<br>\n<br>\nThe third step will lead us to the population for every ZIP Code. To gather this information, we again use urllib, BeautifulSoup and Pandas to read the data from https://www.zipdatamaps.com/zipcodes-cleveland-oh. An example line of items we will use from this page is: 44144 (zip code), Cleveland (zip code name), 5225 (population), Non-Unique (type). After the ZIP Code and the poplation number are saved in a DataFrame, we merged them into the DataFrame which already contains the ZIP Code and its geo coordinates. <br>\n<br>\nIn the last step, we use the Foursquare API in order to receive venues that are nearby for each ZIP Code. We will filter the results to only include the restaurants nearby."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
